# real-or-fake
A classifier to predict whether or not an image is generated by an AI.

Three part blog series, describing this project:
1. [Using ML to detect fake face images created by AI](https://blog.jayway.com/2020/03/06/using-ml-to-detect-fake-face-images-created-by-ai)
2. [Using ML to understand the behavior of an AI](https://blog.jayway.com/2020/06/22/using-ml-to-understand-the-behavior-of-an-ai/)
3. [How long and how much to train an ML-classifier](https://blog.jayway.com/2020/07/01/how-long-and-how-much-to-train-an-ml-classifier/).

To play with the end result of this classifier, head to this super simple [web app](https://real-or-fake.lab.jayway.com)  
The ML-model will present you with its prediction of face images you upload for it to classify.

The classifier I've built is a variation of the [Lab](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson2-download.ipynb) talked about in the course [Deep Learning for Coders ](https://course.fast.ai) in [Lesson 2](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=2) which I expanded into the experimentation talked about in this blog post.
